# 🧩 SQL Tasks
In this part of the project, you need to write several SQL queries in a Jupyter Notebook. These tasks will be manually reviewed, and you’ll receive feedback on your queries.

✅ Don’t forget to connect to the database using SQLAlchemy. Refer to the instructions from Lesson 11: “Cohort Analysis. Presenting Results” in Topic 2: “Installing and Configuring the Database and Client.”

📊 The required data is located in the tables of the stackoverflow schema.

Some tasks include additional questions — don’t miss them. Some can be answered with text, while others require visualization. Remember, you can export the query result to a DataFrame.
To help you better visualize the expected result, we’ve added a small sample of the final table to each task. You can use any appropriate field names in your queries.
